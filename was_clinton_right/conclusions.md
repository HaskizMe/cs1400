Regarding clinton's statement he was right. According to the numbers
the democrats produced roughly 42 million jobs and the Republicans produced 24 million
jobs. Although the numbers may not be 100 percent accurate due to some terms ending
earlier than others, we can conclude that Clinton was right that the democrats have produced
way more jobs than the republicans in the shorter amount of time the democrats have been in office.
